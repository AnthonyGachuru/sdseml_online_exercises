    "**What is a null model?** Null models are alternative instances of data, that are used to assess the amount of signal that is due to pure randomness. For example, you might have\n",
    "measured some signal in your data, like a large number of triangles (high average local clustering coefficient)\n",
    "in your network, but before you go and report that to your boss you need to answer one crucial question: how does\n",
    "this result compare with a *random* one? In other words, how can you be so sure that this high number of triangles\n",
    "measured is not perfectly normal even in a random network of similar origin and therefore not very special after all? The answer: **you\n",
    "create a null model to compare your result with!**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: null models are a concept from the general field of statistics and therefore not just specific to\n",
    "networks. You can use this statistical tool anytime you need to assess how likely it is that your result is random.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common type of null model is one where you shuffle links in your network, while preserving the degree\n",
    "sequence. *(Recall, that the degree sequence is a list that stores the degree of each node. So if we shuffle and\n",
    "preserve the degree sequence at the same time, it means that after all the link-shuffling is done, nodes will\n",
    "have new neighbors, but the same number of neighbors)*. In this shuffled network (the null model), if you find that\n",
    "there are far fewer triangles than in your real data then you can start to argue that your result is significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: the term *null model* is a slight misnomer, as it is not a model per se, but rather an instance of the\n",
    "data that is permuted in some way (usually under constraints, such as preservation of degree sequence), so it can\n",
    "be taken to represent *randomness*. As such, there is no *model*, but rather an *instance* or simply *data*.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that is just one comparison. What if the number of triangles in the random data–the null model–is smaller, but\n",
    "not that much smaller? Can you still say your result is significant? Well, the trick (although computationally expensive\n",
    "as you will come to learn) is to do MANY comparisons. 1000 is not a bad start. For each comparison, you check if\n",
    "the number of triangles in your real data is bigger. After you have compared one thousand times you compute **the\n",
    "fraction of times** your number of triangles in the real data was bigger than in the random data. Guess what that\n",

    "Communities are little lumps of nodes in a network that are unusually strongly connected. Your family is a community, and your friend group from work or university is another community. While there is no one true definition of what a community is, there are many many different methods and algorithms for finding them. Here we will work with one of the most popular ones: [Louvain Modularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_Modularity). The following exercises will walk you through the fundamentals of this method, and finally have you apply it to the network you used last week."

    "> **Ex. 10.2.1**: Assume you have a network where nodes and links tend to form lumps here and there. Imagine you now reach for your pen, and start labeling these nodes with group names (or ids) that feel appropriate according to how they are lumped together. If your partition is \"good\", nodes that are connected in groups should intuitively have the same label, while nodes that are distant and disconnected should have different labels. Modularity is a function that can be used to measure, by this logic, *how good* your partition is. It is in technical terms a *utility function*, and it looks like this:\n",

    "> <br>\n",
    "> Your job in this problem is to explain this equation. When I look at daunting math I find it calming to try and read it as if it were code. Since all math can be implemented in code, all math can be broken into parts, where each part does a seperate thing. Answer each question below seperately:\n",
    "1. In code, a sum, $\\sum$, is like a `for` loop, where in every iteration you increment a variable. In the equation for modularity the little $ij$ subscript tells is what the sum is looping over (like `for ij in sumloop`). But what is $ij$?\n",
    "2. In each iteration of the sum, the delta function $\\delta(c_i, c_j)$ is used, where $c_i$ is the community label of node $i$. The delta function is a very simple program that returns 0 if the two input values are different and 1 if they are they same. How would you implement the delta function in code? What is it used for in the modularity equation?\n",
    "3. Inside the sum we use the term $\\frac{k_ik_j}{2m}$ as our *null model*. $k$ is the degree sequence (so $k_i$ is the degree of node $i$) and $m$ is the sum of all link weights. Explain what this null model measures. Could we have used other null models?\n",
    "4. The sum subtracts the null model from $A_{ij}$ and adds the result to its final value if the delta function evaluates to 1. What is the point of only summing over this difference when the delta function is 1?\n",
    "5. The sum term is normalized by $2m$. Why exactly $2m$?\n",
    "6. Summarize your insight gained from answering the above questions. In your own words, explain how the modularity function works. Use 1-3 sentences.\n"
