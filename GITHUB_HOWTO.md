# How to git+github

In the readme I describe briefly how to interact with this repo:
  * Fork this repository.
  * Clone your fork to your PC.
  * Create your (group) folder and add any material you would like.
  * Commit your changes to git.
  * Push your changes to your fork.
  * Create a pull request, requesting to pull the changes from your fork into this repository.

In this document I will go through the steps 1-by-1. 

## 1. Fork this repository
To begin with the repository sits in _my_ github account, and the url is _https://github.com/Kristianuruplarsen/sdseml_online_exercises_. Our first step will be to copy all of these files to _your_ account. To do this, navigate to my repo and click on _fork_.

![fork it](https://github.com/Kristianuruplarsen/sdseml_online_exercises/tree/master/TA_EXAMPLE_FOLDER/FIGURES/hit_fork.PNG)

You should see a screen pop up, informing you that the files are being copied. 

## 2. Clone your fork to your PC
Now you have a personal version of my repository, but it lives on github. We need to download all of these files to your computer for you to work with them. To do this open _your fork of the repository_ (url: _https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sdseml_online_exercises_)
