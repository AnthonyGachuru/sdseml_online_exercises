    "We want to plot the network so we can visually get a feeling for how people are connected. `networkx`'s `nx.draw` method won't cut it here, it's too slow and has bad layout support for large networks, so instead we'll use `netwulf` ([docs](https://netwulf.readthedocs.io/)) to visualize networks in a browser-app I made (still in beta, bugs may occur). But even with this tool, the network of one year is still too big to make nice visualizations, so we have to reduce the number of links and nodes by some heuristic. This could for example be to threshold link weight to reduce the number of links, thresholding weighted node degree (or other relevant metrics)."
